# Snakes-and-Ladders-Simulation

I wanted to complete a simulation of 10 000 games of Snakes and Ladders, to answer how many turns it would take in one player and two player games to complet, also what the win percentages are in two player games, and lastly how the game could be changed to even the odds for both players. I created functions for both one player and two player games. I ran the simulation 10 000 times for each one player and two player games. Then I answered the question presented to me based on the PDF document.
